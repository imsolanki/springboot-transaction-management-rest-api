# KiranaStore Management System

## Overview

The KiranaStore Management System is a Spring Boot project designed to manage transactions and stores in a Kirana store context. The system consists of two main entities: `stores` and `transactions`. These entities are mapped in a one-to-many relationship, allowing you to track transactions for each individual Kirana store.
